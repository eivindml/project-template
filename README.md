## Best Practices

### Software & Services

Online services used:
- Notes etc. in Evernote
- Project Management in Trello
- Time Tracking in Timely
- Slack for chat/status/information center
- Github for version control
- Zeplin for developer design deliveries
- Invision for prototypes and client feedback

Tools used:
- Sketch
- Atom
- Xcode

### Design

#### Systematical organization

Use Atomic Design Principals. http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#atoms

#### Naming conventions

- Use prefixes. Examples: img_header, ic_header, bg_header
- Names should be in english by convention. This may sound weird if you're a native english speaker, but if you are used to communicate in another language, try to keep your elements' names in english or at least leave out accents and symbols that only make sense in your language.
- Talk to the developers that work with you, show them the way you organize your files and commit to it for the whole project.
- Use this-naming-convention.

#### Export directly into a folder
This is simple and builds on tip No. 2. If you place a prefix: “<folder>/” before the name of your layer then it will export into that folder. For instance “alex/img_mockup@2x.png” would export the file “img_mockup@2x.png” into a folder named “alex”.

#### Quickly conseptualize
Use Paparazzi app.

### Code

#### iOS

#### Web
